# IPL-Score-Prediction
This code builds an IPL score predictor using a neural network with two hidden layers. It preprocesses data using label encoding and scaling, trains with Huber loss, and evaluates performance with Mean Absolute Error. An interactive interface allows users to input values like teams and players to dynamically predict scores via `ipywidgets`.
